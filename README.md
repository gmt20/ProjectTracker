# ProjectTracker
A simple web application written in pure java script (ES6). For styling, bootstrap CSS has been used. The idea has been taken from https://codingthesmartway.com/
But I have written the code in ES6 and used table element to display,update and delete projects. Only status and progress attrivutes are editable in the project table. The app also tracks the date on which the project was started and last updated.
